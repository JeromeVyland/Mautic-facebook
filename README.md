# Mautic-facebook leads
Use Facebook Webhook and Mautic API to automatically create contact in Mautic when a Lead is generated via Facebook ads.

Use platform.php to subscribe to page where you started your facebook lead generation ad.
Install Mautic API Library: https://github.com/mautic/api-library
Enable and create API credential in Mautic 

This was a quick work i didn't validate nor optmize all data and variables.

Here is a video tutorial explaining how to use this files: https://youtu.be/Jr98BOamcGo

There is an easier way to create contact on Mautic via form submissions instead of Mautic API. I will create a video showing how when I get some time. i included a new file called webhook-forms.php that uses Mautic forms.
